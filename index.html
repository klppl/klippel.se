  <p>This is my personal blog. Sometimes I write about things I find on the internet, sometimes about other nerdy things. Perhaps a bit about programming and other things that interest me. Every now and then, maybe something about my personal life and experiences as a dad.</p>
<p>I would describe myself as an internet nerd or enthusiast. I like to share what I find with others.</p>
<p>You can find me on <a href="http://github.com/klppl">Github</a>, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/dysalexi">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://instagram.com/alexander.klippel">Instagram</a>. Even on boomer social media like <a href="https://facebook.com/klippelalexander">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/alexanderklippel">LinkedIn</a>. You can find music I like and repost on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/klippel">Soundcloud</a>.</p>
<p>I also have an <a href="https://youtube.com/@pappageek">YouTube channel</a>, but it&rsquo;s not very active.</p>
